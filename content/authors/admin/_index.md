I have been working on bioinformatics and statistical genetics focused projects. I have extensive experience in academic, clinical and industry collaborations with researchers in the US and Australia. I have gained key expertise in the analysis of large clinically focused datasets. The goals of these research were to characterize and understand the genetic origin of disease and to translate these findings into clinical practice.

I am interested in big data analysis, algorithm development and scientific computing.
