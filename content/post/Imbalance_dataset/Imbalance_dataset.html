<p>The challenge is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.</p>
<p>Main challenges involved in credit card fraud detection are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Enormous Data is processed every day and the model build must be fast enough to respond to the scam in time.</li>
<li>Imbalanced Data i.e most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones</li>
<li>Data availability as the data is mostly private.</li>
<li>Misclassified Data can be another major issue, as not every fraudulent transaction is caught and reported.</li>
<li>Adaptive techniques used against the model by the scammers.</li>
</ol>
<p>How to tackle these challenges?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.</li>
<li>Imbalance can be dealt with by properly using some methods which we will talk about in the next paragraph</li>
<li>For protecting the privacy of the user the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.</li>
<li>A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-check the data, at least for training the model.</li>
<li>We can make the model simple and interpretable so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="python"><code># import the necessary packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from matplotlib import gridspec</code></pre>
<p>Comparison with other algorithms without dealing with the imbalancing of the data.</p>

<p>As we can clearly see that with our Random Forest Model we are getting a better result even for the recall which is the most tricky part.</p>
