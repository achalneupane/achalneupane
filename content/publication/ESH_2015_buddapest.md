**Abstract**


Whole exome sequencing (WES) can detect a high proportion of cancer causing genetic mutations, and therefore has the potential to replace targeted molecular assays and identify additional novel, patient-specific mutations. To test the ability of WES to detect variants of clinical consequence, we compared WES findings to results for FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut obtained by routine pathology testing (high-resolution fragment analysis (HRFA) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization â€“ Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) respectively), and to point mutation findings in DNMT3A, IDH1/2, JAK2, KRAS, NRAS and MPL, as determined by Sequenom, across a cohort of 188 AML samples from adults (n
= 144) and children (n = 44). All subjects provided written informed consent, and the study protocols had been approved by institutional research ethics committees. Median age at diagnosis was 51 years, (range 1-89) and median bone marrow blast percentage was 76% (range 8-100).
A discovery phase using 96 samples developed genotype algorithms and ascertained their sensitivity. NPM1mut were reliably detected using WES, with 100% (n=25 positive) concordance with MALDI-TOF. WES and Sequenom were 99.4% concordant over the selected gene panels (1594 measurements). The FLT3-ITD false negative rate initially exceeded 50%, leading us to optimize our discovery algorithms and develop a calibration curve which specified the sequence coverage needed over the FLT3-ITD region to reliably genotype at any allelic ratio (AR). We demonstrate that our algorithms can reliably detect FLT3-ITD with AR > 0.05 using exome capture with less than 100x coverage over the FLT3-ITD region.
Additionally, we tested the algorithms over another 900 germline controls with no false positive measurements.
In a validation phase using 78 samples, all NPM1mut samples (n=20 positive) were detected, including an additional NPM1mut (type A) initially missed using MALDI-TOF. Concordance with Sequenom again exceeded 99.5% (comparable to the error rate expected in this Sequenom panel). For FLT3-ITD, 18/21 HRFA-positive samples were detected with all 3 false-negatives falling outside the predicted sensitivity threshold; two samples with AR <0.01 (which would require sequencing coverage of 500x for detection) and one with AR = 0.4 but with a sequence coverage of only 38x over the FLT3-ITD.
In conclusion, we have performed WES on one of the largest cohorts of adult and paediatric AML described to date and demonstrate that clinically relevant mutations, including FLT3-ITD and NPM1mut, can be simultaneously detected with a single exome capture platform with accuracy similar to or better than current methods.
